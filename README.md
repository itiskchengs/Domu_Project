 ## Description 
 Domu is a neighborhood restaurant and bar that offers house made noodles creative takes on small plates and seasonal cocktails. I decided to take on this personal project and redesign their current site. I felt that I could give a different design spin on it improve the user experience and a more user-friendly design. Tools used are JavaScript(ES6) CSS3 HTML5 Bootstrap5 and GSAP.
